Theo Dapamede is a postdoctoral fellow at Emory University. He is actively contributing to the advancement of medical AI and its impact on patient care. His journey began with an MD from Brawijaya University in Indonesia, leading him to pursue a PhD at Otago University, New Zealand. There, he focused on building AI models for image reconstruction, denoising, and material decomposition in spectral photon counting CT scans.

Currently, Theo is experimenting with different preprocessing techniques during dataset curation, and is also exploring the exciting possibility of using AI in opportunistic scans to potentially discover hidden clues about diseases. He has presented research on the importance of DICOM Look Up Tables (LUT) in medical image preprocessing for training deep learning models. His work suggests that utilizing DICOM LUT enhances deep learning model performance and generalizability.
